Models:
In the folder "models", 40 folders are made corresponding to each phoneme, each folder contains 20 models as per the requirment.
These files are:-
energy_2.pkl :- mfcc, mixtures=2, with energy coefficients
energy_4.pkl :- mfcc, mixtures=4, with energy coefficients
energy_8.pkl :- mfcc, mixtures=8, with energy coefficients
energy_16.pkl :- mfcc, mixtures=16, with energy coefficients
energy_32.pkl :- mfcc, mixtures=32, with energy coefficients
energy_64.pkl :- mfcc, mixtures=64, with energy coefficients
energy_128.pkl :- mfcc, mixtures=128, with energy coefficients
energy_256.pkl :- mfcc, mixtures=256, with energy coefficients
mfcc_2.pkl :- mfcc, mixtures=2, without energy coefficients
mfcc_4.pkl :- mfcc, mixtures=4, without energy coefficients
mfcc_8.pkl :- mfcc, mixtures=8, without energy coefficients
mfcc_16.pkl :- mfcc, mixtures=16, without energy coefficients
mfcc_32.pkl :- mfcc, mixtures=32, without energy coefficients
mfcc_64.pkl :- mfcc, mixtures=64, without energy coefficients
mfcc_128.pkl :- mfcc, mixtures=128, without energy coefficients
mfcc_256.pkl :- mfcc, mixtures=256, without energy coefficients
energy_delta.pkl :- mfcc_delta, mixtures=64, with energy coefficients
delta.pkl :-mfcc_delta, mixtures=64, without energy coefficients
energy_delta_delta.pkl:-mfcc_delta_delta, mixtures=64, with energy coefficients
delta_delta.pkl:-mfcc_delta_delta, mixtures=64, without energy coefficients


Accuracies:
test.py on running prints all the frame_accuracies for every model i.e.
mfcc (number of mixtures=[2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256], with energy coefficients),  
mfcc (number of mixtures=[2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256], without energy coefficients)
mfcc_delta(with energy coefficients)
mfcc_delta(without energy coefficients)
mfcc_delta_delta(with energy coeficcients)
mfcc_delta_delta(without energy coefficients)

The best accuracies we attained was with MFCC_DELTA_DELTA model WITH ENERGY COEFFICIENTS that is ~19.5% approx., which implies that for the given timit dataset, the energy coefficients play a significant role fro classification.

Also some changes were made in import_timit.py to ease the flow of this project.
All the PERs have been saved in a text file accuracies.txt, which contains PER for every file for every model, as well as frame accuracies for every model.
